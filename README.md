##Tic-Tac-Toe
*Project 4 of Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript course*

###Project objectives:
Build a functional two-person Tic-Tac-Toe game. Use the provided mockups, HTML, CSS and image files to create a game that requires players to add their names and take turns adding an X or O to the game board.

* When the page loads, display the startup screen. When the player clicks the start button the initial screen disappears, the board appears and the game begins.

* Indicate the current player at the top of the page. When a player mouses over a square, a player-specific SVG appears. Ensure players can only click on empty squares.

* Keep track of the state of the game â€” whose turn it is, where the Xs and Os are on the board, who won or lost, and whether the game is a draw. Announce when the game ends by displaying the relevant screen.

* For extra credit, let a player add their name before the game starts, and add programming to support playing against the computer.
